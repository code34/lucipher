	LUCIPHER uses a 2048-bits encryption algorithm, and does not contain any
	security mechanism to protect against encryption of certain types of files,
	or even confirmation before encryption. If you use it, you use it at your
	own risk. This can lead to non-reversible encryption operations, potentially
	resulting in the complete loss of your data. Always check your command
	line before launching lucipher.

	Usage for cipher
	.\lucipher.exe -p passphrase -s sourcefile -d destinationfile

	Usage for uncipher
	.\lucipher.exe -p passphrase -s sourcefile -d destinationfile -u
